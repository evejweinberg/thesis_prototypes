FEAR: works the first time it's entered
but the 2nd time it just starts at 24 and doesn't animate


ALL BUTTONS: only work the first time they're used, no matter what button brought them there
(Ex: transparency, and loss aversion)
//the click event is removed from the page because the element with that id is removed from the page, so the click event must be re-added
